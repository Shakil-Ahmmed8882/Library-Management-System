# Library Management System

## Project Overview
The **Library Management System** is a backend API designed to manage books, members, and borrowing activities within a library. It allows staff and members to interact with the libraryâ€™s resources, including managing book details, membership information, and borrowing/returning books. This project provides a clean, efficient, and scalable solution for libraries to manage their day-to-day operations.

## Technology Stack
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building the API.
- **Express.js**: Web framework to handle HTTP requests.
- **Prisma ORM**: To interact with the PostgreSQL database using an object-relational mapping approach.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing books, members, and borrow records.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety and better development experience.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Implemented for managing books and members.
- **Borrowing System**: Allows users to borrow and return books, keeping track of the borrow records.
- **Overdue Tracking**: Tracks overdue borrowed books based on a 14-day return policy.
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear and structured error messages for failed operations.

## Endpoints

This API exposes the following key endpoints:
